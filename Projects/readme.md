### Explanation
- **Project Directories**: Each project is self-contained within its own folder, ensuring modularity and organization.
- **HTML Files**: Serve as the entry points for each project, with additional pages (e.g., `about.html`) as needed.
- **CSS & JS Folders**: Separate directories for styles and scripts, promoting code reuse and maintainability.
- **Assets**: Images, fonts, and other media are stored in dedicated folders within each project, keeping content separate from code.
