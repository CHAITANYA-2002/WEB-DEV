## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites
- Git
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- An Azure account (for deployment)

### Steps
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHAITANYA-2002/FUTURE_READY_TALENT.git
   cd FUTURE_READY_TALENT
   ```

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Since this is a static web app, you can open `index.html` directly in a browser:
     ```bash
     open index.html
     ```
   - Alternatively, use a local development server (e.g., VS Codeâ€™s Live Server extension) for a better experience:
     ```bash
     code .  # Open in VS Code
     # Use Live Server extension to launch the app
     ```

---

## Usage

1. **Explore the Blog**:
   - Open the app in a browser to access the home page (`index.html`).
   - Use the carousel banner to view featured posts (e.g., "Artificial Intelligence," "Top 10 Gadgets").
   - Browse blog sections to read articles on topics like laptops, smartphones, and robotics.
   - Check the sidebar for recent posts, categories, and social media links.
   - Toggle between light and dark themes using the switch in the header.

2. **Interact with Features**:
   - Click the play button in the video section to watch a Pexels video in a popup.
   - Use the subscription form to enter an email address (note: this is a placeholder; no backend is implemented).
   - Navigate to the About and Contact pages using the header links.

3. **Example Blog Post**:
   - Title: "Artificial Intelligence"
   - Author: Techie Pedia
   - Likes: 12
   - Comments: 9
   - Description: "Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua."

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Azure Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Deployment Steps
1. **Set Up Azure Static Web Apps**:
   - In the Azure portal, create a new Static Web App.
   - Link your GitHub repository (`CHAITANYA-2002/FUTURE_READY_TALENT`) during setup.
   - Configure the app settings:
     - App location: `/`
     - Output location: `/`
     - API location: (leave blank, as thereâ€™s no backend)

2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**:
   - A workflow file (`.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps.yml`) is likely included to automate deployment.
   - On each push to the `main` branch, the app is built and deployed to Azure.

3. **Access the Deployed App**:
   - After deployment, Azure provides a URL (e.g., `https://<app-name>.azurestaticapps.net`).
   - Note: The exact URL is not specified here as it depends on your deployment setup.
